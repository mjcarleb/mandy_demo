## Technical Python goals:
- (TBD) Create virtual environment using pipenv
- (TBD) Run programs in Docker container (optional when Mark took)
- (TBD) If using Docker, connect PyCharm IDE to Python interpreter running in the Docker container (or on AWS instance) to debug code running in container (https://www.dabbleofdevops.com/blog/setup-pycharm-to-use-a-project-interpreter-in-a-docker-compose-service)
- (done) Use PyCharm to create programs and debug
- (done) Use git and GitHub for version control
- (done) Understand module vs. package vs. distribution
- (done) Know to create distribution using setup.py
- (done) Know how to install local "my_package" in site packages using pip install . so that you can import from my_package just like you import numpy
- (done) Create and run unit tests using UnitTest
- (done) Create and run unit tests using pytest
- (done) Modify .ini files to control test discovery by pytest
- (done) Use list comprehension
- (done) Use dictionary comprehension
- (done) Use generator
- (done) Use lambda functions, map, filter, reduce
- (done) Use nested list comprehension
- (done) Use *args and **kwargs inside of function
- (done) Use * and ** to pass values to arguments of function
- (done) Create context manager with class and with @contextmanager
- (done) Use decorator (function, class, @wraps, functools)
- (done) Use __call__()
- (done) Use property, setter, getter
- Only discussed briefly (see article below on composition, argparse, etc.):
    - Use isa inheritance
    - Use hasa composition
    - Use __super__()
    - Use command line arguments

- Review @property decorator to create getter, setter and deleter
- Look at example with argparse, etc.
- Look at article on argparse
- Look at example with __super__()
- Look at article on inheritance and composition
